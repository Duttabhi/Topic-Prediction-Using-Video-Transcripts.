00:00:00 hey welcome to high-resolution my name is Bobby Ghoshal and I'm Jared erondu we're going to sit down with 25 masters of the design industry and we're going to learn from them we're going to learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and deploy design and their businesses every single day 
00:00:30 experience design at Airbnb should focus on how to frame user experiences and you storytelling to lead a discussion we're going to get to that stick around right after these Parker messages thanks to Squarespace for their support whether you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move is Squarespace visit squarespace.com and enter the code high-resolution one word for 10% off your 
00:01:00 purchase hey thanks for joining us what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you feel is not so there's other people getting better but I would say don't know that design is more than what you see Steve Jobs said that it's not just what it looks like the how it works and paraphrasing 
00:01:30 and of course I believe in that but there's a little bit more to that when we think about design we often think about solving problems by Design in its simplest sentence is just being intentional about something trying to solve a problem thinking about the end user hopefully doing so in a may be a collaborative Fashion Week the fashion these are often times the schools of design but you can 
00:02:00 those tools for really solving kind of almost any problem so it might be and what the interface on an app looks like and what color is it has and where the buttons go and how that works but it can also be the strategy or the shape of the org and how people work together and who works with whom these are the types of things that you can use that tool set of design 
00:02:30 how far and I don't know if that's wide enough it's known wide enough unfortunately but we're getting there for sure what is so it sounds like you're saying there's this thing that we can use Hall design for things outside of you turn our faces we can solve business problems and we can design teams using this process what what are some of the things that you've used in this process 
00:03:00 let's be clear while there are people that have job titles that involve designer like myself it doesn't necessarily mean that each design is a method for solving problems as I mention it's about bringing intentionality to it and good design I feel includes a humanistic approach try to consider who the n 
00:03:30 user is doing at work you might be thinking about what who are the people in that organization that are going to be affected by what the shape of that organization looks like and so either you bring the tools of research and you get out and you learn from those individuals what they want what they don't want try to understand and what might come of these decisions that you might make and then the other part of the tool set is iteration designers designers utilize 
00:04:00 duration and so that might mean that they make a low Fidelity version of the their idea their solution first and test it out so that again can learn from the end User Group to know whether or not it's working I basically leaving your assumptions on the table so to speak and trying to find what that right solution might be another tool in that tool set would be a collaboration a great design and believe works with the collaborative team 
00:04:30 disciplinary team because we don't know every answer and I'm trying to say that because I can solve just about any problem well we're not an expert in just about any problem and people using designer not an expert in everything they have to bring people together other experts that you can learn from in order to develop those Solutions collaboration 
00:05:00 one of the things that I in my in my designer past I found to be really interesting is iteration once you get the hang of it once you understand that that's a key component of the design process may become so obvious that you need to do it cuz it didn't think one of the superpowers is on your tab is that we can just create stuff from The Ether and do it a thousand times really quickly Wright Engineers don't have that Leisure but the kind of excited that coin is 
00:05:30 iterate on something you do that low Fidelity at the business people hate like the non-designers they seem to generally not be able to get past the fact that it looks like crap but it needs to look like crap in order in order for it to move board like how would you explain the art of iteration in the importance of iteration to someone in the business lower-risk face 
00:06:00 okay I know it's hear you it can be difficult to show somebody something that isn't all the way thought through and you know they start poking it and it will that that copy is wrong or you know that it's too big for the area that's going to be and they might have great points but you're you're trying to direct their conversation props to something else I've been keeping it low Fidelity and helping them see the stages of what 
00:06:30 working towards I think one way to solve for that is that you show them what like what you can do in terms of the high-fidelity version like we'll get to this polished screen that has all the right bells and whistles but in order to get there first. Make sure we have that idea right or let's make sure we have the interaction model right where we were talking about an orc like let's make sure that you know before we go and move desks around you know when we're going to put new signage up and everything but before we do that I like let's try to 
00:07:00 scenario planning here what is it going to look like when we have people over here and poop over there I haven't think through some of those scenarios like a meeting right like you give yourself examples of that but I think I need to be able to know that you will get it to the end if you've been here for a few years and they are going to be since then the design side is like reshuffle bit layout 
00:07:30 structure however you guys work together and that's that's like it's going to happen. Sense of adaptability but how has every me actually approach this yeah I mean we definitely going to company with him hyper-growth and I started here almost three years ago and it was about 10 people in the experience of 19 and now it's close to 80 hits
